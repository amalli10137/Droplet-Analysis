This code allows the user to easily analyze droplet coalescence events. An important data point during these events is the radius of the neck formed between the two droplets as they merge. The user can imput an image stack, select an area of interest within the image, rotate the droplet, select the axis of merging, and this code will output the neck radius as a function of time. A really nice feature I've added is that a modified image stack will be saved, with the neck radius shown as a red line so the user can verify the neck radius has correctly been identified. Below are images from the workflow.
